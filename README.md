### Description 

* Make a new Xcode app and name it : Slader Color
* You need to make a view with the following elements : view for display the results (your final color), 3 sliders for change the red,green and bleu value, 3 switch button to change turn on/off the color state.  
* You need to have a "Reset Button" to initialize your color (back to Black color).  

To make a color, you need 4 informations. Red, Green, Blue and Alpha. Alpha is the opacity of the view.<br>
So find the best way to change the background color of the view by using the 3 sliders.
